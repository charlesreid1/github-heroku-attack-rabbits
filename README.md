## What's this business all about, then?

This repository helps you protect your secret pages by (deep breath):

hosting your secret page of static and/or dynamic content using a free Heroku app 
running a Python Flask server that uses Flask-Dance to authenticate visitors 
with Github which allows you fine-grained access control over your pages based on
user attributes like organization or team membership or even things like how many
repositories a user has or how many vowels are in their username. 

Also, did I mention the attack rabbits?
