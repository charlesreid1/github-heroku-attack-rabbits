# Deploying to Heroku

Once we have debugged the Flask app and we are happy with it,
we are ready to deploy it to Heroku. To deploy content to Heroku,
we just add our Heroku project as a git remote (see the [heroku](heroku.md)
page for how to do that) and then push to the master branch of the 
heroku remote git repo. Changes are pulled in by Heroku and the 
app is restarted each time you run git push.
